# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This SRS defines the **software requirements** for P11.

It translates the P11 product requirements baseline into precise,
observable, and testable system behaviour.

The SRS specifies:

- system functions;
- actor interactions;
- business-rule enforcement;
- state transitions;
- authorization behaviour;
- validation behaviour;
- privacy behaviour;
- error behaviour;
- notifications;
- auditability;
- external-system interaction requirements;
- measurable non-functional requirements;
- system-level acceptance conditions.

---

## 1.2 Scope of the System

The system shall support the complete mentoring lifecycle. Alumni
onboarding and the student career profile are independent flows that
come together during mentor discovery and matching:

```

Messaging and notifications shall support the lifecycle wherever
applicable.

## 1.3 Source of Requirements

The requirements in this document are derived from:

1.  the P11 PRD v1.0 baseline;
2.  the authoritative P11 source extract in `docs/P11_Project_Source.md`;
3.  the applicable Common Engineering Standard.

The P11 specification defines the core capabilities, actors,
project-specific correctness guarantees, privacy requirements, testing
expectations, integrations, and acceptance criteria.

---

## 1.4 Requirement Language

The following terms are used consistently:

---

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Shall** | Mandatory system requirement. |
| **Shall not** | Prohibited system behaviour. |
| **Should** | Recommended behaviour where the requirement is not mandatory. |
| **May** | Optional capability. |

---

A requirement marked **Shall** is mandatory unless explicitly deferred
from the approved release scope.

---

## 1.5 Requirement Quality Rules

Each normative requirement in this SRS should be:

- uniquely identified;
- implementation-independent where possible;
- observable through system behaviour;
- testable;
- traceable to the PRD or project source.

placement outcomes only from an institution-approved source or adapter.

### EXT-16

The system shall distinguish unavailable placement-source data from a
valid result containing no placement outcomes.

### EXT-17

Placement outcomes shall remain institution-scoped and shall be available
only to authorized institutional analytics roles. They shall not be

---

# 19. System States and Transition Rules

The following states define required observable lifecycle behaviour.

## 19.1 Verification

```text
Pending
  ├──→ Verified
  └──→ Rejected
```

### ST-01

Only a pending verification request may transition to a verification
outcome.

### ST-02

A rejected or verified verification request shall not be treated as
pending.

---

## 19.2 Mentorship Request

```text
Pending
  ├──→ Accepted
  ├──→ Declined
  └──→ Expired
```

### ST-03

Only a pending request may be accepted or declined.

### ST-04

Only a pending unanswered request may expire.

### ST-05

An accepted, declined, or expired request shall not transition back to
pending through ordinary user action.

### ST-06

An expired request shall never create an active mentorship.

---

## 19.3 Mentorship

The system shall distinguish an active mentorship relationship from a
non-active or ended relationship condition.

The mentorship lifecycle shall support:

```text
Active
   ↓
Ended
```

### ST-07

Only a valid accepted request may create an active mentorship.

### ST-08

An active mentorship shall be the parent context for its valid sessions,
goals, actions, feedback, messages, and engagement records.

### ST-08A

Only an active mentorship may transition to ended. Ending the relationship
shall release its active capacity allocation while preserving historical
records according to the retention policy.

---

## 19.4 Session

The system shall distinguish at least:

```text
Proposed
   ├──→ Scheduled
   └──→ Cancelled

Scheduled
   ├──→ Completed
   └──→ Cancelled
```

### ST-09

A session cannot be marked scheduled unless it is in the proposed state.
A proposed session may be cancelled, while a scheduled session may be
marked completed or cancelled. Completed and cancelled sessions cannot be
reopened.

---

## 19.5 Engagement

The system shall represent an engagement condition sufficient to
distinguish healthy or active engagement from declining engagement and
inactivity. The exact state taxonomy remains configurable through the
open engagement requirements.

### ST-10

A relationship shall be identified as showing declining engagement when
the configured criteria are met.

### ST-11

A relationship shall be identified as recovered after qualifying activity
demonstrates recovery.

### ST-12

A relationship shall be identified as inactive when the configured
inactivity condition is met.

---

# 20. System-Level Acceptance Requirements

The following requirements directly operationalize the P11 acceptance
outcomes. The P11 source explicitly requires verification with an audit
trail, protected capacity including concurrency, configurable
throttling, absolute contact privacy, ranked/explained matching,
scheduling with calendar integration and reminders, engagement
detection/nudges, and programme reporting.

---

| ID | System Acceptance Requirement | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 | Alumni verification completes against institutional records and produces an audit trail. | Successful end-to-end verification and audit evidence |
| AC-02 | Mentor capacity cannot be exceeded under normal or concurrent acceptance. | Concurrent acceptance test |
| AC-03 | Student mentorship-request throttling is enforced and configurable. | Configuration and positive/negative test evidence |
| AC-04 | Alumni email and phone details are absent from every student-accessible endpoint response and view. | Exhaustive authorization and privacy testing |
| AC-05 | Matching returns ranked mentors with an understandable reason for every displayed recommendation. | Matching test dataset and result evidence |
| AC-06 | Sessions can be scheduled with enabled calendar integration and reminders. | End-to-end scheduling test |
| AC-07 | Declining engagement is detected and the appropriate nudge is issued. | Engagement test and notification evidence |
| AC-08 | Programme reporting covers participation, sessions, goals, and outcomes. | Generated programme report |
| AC-09 | Student-facing screens satisfy WCAG 2.2 AA requirements. | Accessibility test evidence |
| AC-10 | Security controls required by CES are evidenced and no High/Critical dependency findings remain at handover. | Security and dependency reports |

---

## 20.1 CES Testing Requirements

The system shall satisfy the applicable CES testing baseline:

- unit testing with at least 70% statement coverage for domain/service
  layers;
- component/form testing for shared components and forms;
- integration testing for every endpoint, including
  authorization-failure paths;
- end-to-end testing for every critical journey named by the project's
  acceptance criteria;
- load testing against the concurrency targets;
- security testing;
- accessibility testing;
- explicit concurrency testing where P11 defines correctness
  guarantees;
- 10 working days of UAT with defect severity classification.

These requirements come from the shared CES testing baseline.

  scanning policy.
- Exact rejected-verification retry behaviour.

- Behaviour when a mentor attempts to reduce capacity below their current
  number of active mentees.

## 21.3 Requests

- Maximum student requests per period.

## 21.5 Visibility and Privacy

- Exact student-visible mentor fields.
- Additional post-acceptance visibility rules.

## 21.6 Engagement

- Nudge timing/frequency.
- Recovery criteria.
- Treatment of long-term paused relationships.
- Final engagement state taxonomy and transition names.

## 21.7 Integrations

- Initial pilot population.

## 21.9 Messaging and Retention

- Message-history retention and access policy after a mentorship ends.
- Retention period for mentoring data and other non-academic records.

These values are recorded rather than invented because the supplied P11
brief does not define them.
