---

## 1. Purpose

This PRD defines the **product** requirements for P11: why the product exists, who it serves, what problem it solves, what outcomes it should create, what capabilities are required, and how the major user journeys should work.

---

## 2. Product Vision

Create a trusted university platform that turns alumni goodwill into a **structured, sustainable, and measurable mentoring programme**.

The platform connects students with verified alumni mentors according to career goals and professional expertise while protecting mentor capacity and keeping alumni contact details private.

### Expected Product Outcome

A sustained mentoring programme with measurable engagement, protected alumni capacity, and outcomes that the institution can report.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Alumni are willing to help students, but mentoring is currently unstructured:

- connections are ad hoc;
- access to alumni support is uneven;
- mentoring activity is difficult for the institution to see and measure;
- relationships can lose momentum without follow-up;
- alumni can be over-contacted by students who discover them through external platforms;
- students lack a consistent way to discover appropriate mentors;
- mentors lack a structured way to control their mentoring workload.

P11 therefore needs to create a mentoring programme that works for three groups simultaneously:

- **Students:** useful access to relevant mentors.
- **Alumni:** control over time, capacity, and participation.
- **Institution:** visibility into participation, engagement, and outcomes.

---

## 4. Core Product Principle

### Protect the Mentor's Time

This is the central product principle of P11.

Capacity limits, request throttling, and easy declining are first-class product features. The product should make it possible for alumni to help students without feeling overwhelmed or pressured.

Every significant product decision should be evaluated against this principle.

---

## 5. Product Objectives

1. **Establish trust** — verify alumni before they participate as mentors.
2. **Capture professional context** — record expertise, mentoring interests, capacity, and availability.
3. **Understand student needs** — record career goals, interests, target roles, and industries.
4. **Improve discovery** — help students find relevant mentors.
5. **Make matching understandable** — provide a reason for mentor recommendations.
6. **Protect capacity** — prevent mentors from being overloaded.
7. **Support the relationship** — manage the mentoring journey from request through sessions, goals, actions, and feedback.
8. **Sustain engagement** — identify declining activity and encourage follow-up.
9. **Protect privacy** — keep alumni personal contact information private.
10. **Measure outcomes** — provide institutional visibility into programme performance.

---

## 6. Target Users and Product Roles

## 10. Product Rules

**PR-01 — Verification:** Alumni must be verified against institutional records before mentor status is granted.

**PR-02 — Capacity:** A mentor cannot have more active mentees than their declared capacity.

**PR-03 — Participation control:** A mentor can pause and resume mentoring participation.

**PR-04 — Request throttling:** Students cannot send unlimited mentorship requests.

**PR-05 — Configurable limits:** The programme can configure applicable request limits.

**PR-06 — Request expiry:** Unanswered requests expire according to the programme's configured policy.

**PR-07 — Easy decline:** Declining a request is a valid, low-friction outcome. A decline reason may be optional.

**PR-08 — Capacity-aware discovery:** Mentors who cannot accept additional mentees should not be presented as available request targets.

**PR-09 — Explainable matching:** Mentor recommendations must communicate why the mentor is relevant.

**PR-10 — Contact privacy:** Alumni email addresses and phone numbers must not be exposed to students through the platform.

**PR-11 — Relationship focus:** Sessions, goals, actions, feedback, and engagement are part of the mentoring relationship.

**PR-12 — Follow-up:** Declining engagement should result in an appropriate follow-up experience.

**PR-13 — Institutional visibility:** Programme reporting should provide useful institutional insight without exposing alumni private contact information.

---

## 11. Privacy Product Requirement

P11 must balance institutional visibility with alumni privacy.

Students should receive enough professional and mentoring information to make an informed mentoring decision, including relevant expertise and appropriate capacity/availability information.

Students must not receive alumni personal:

- email addresses;
- phone numbers.

---

## 12. Product Integrations

The product specification identifies the following integration needs:

| ERP / alumni records | Alumni verification   |
| University SSO       | Institutional sign-in |
| Google Calendar      | Calendar scheduling   |
| Microsoft Outlook    | Calendar scheduling   |

| SMS                  | Notifications         |
| LinkedIn (optional)  | Profile prefill       |

---

## 13. Programme Analytics

The product should enable programme owners to answer:

### Participation

- How many students participate?
- How many alumni are active mentors?
- How many mentorships are active?

### Requests

- How many requests are sent?

- How much mentor capacity is being used?

### Engagement

- Which relationships show declining engagement?
- Which relationships recover after follow-up?

### Effectiveness and outcomes

- How satisfied are students and mentors?
- What patterns indicate mentor effectiveness?
- How does mentoring participation relate to placement outcomes?

---

## 14. Product Success Metrics

The following metrics should be tracked during pilot and operation:

| Area         | Metric                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verification | Successful alumni verification rate                       |
| Discovery    | Students finding suitable available mentors               |

| Requests     | Acceptance rate                                           |
| Requests     | Decline rate                                              |
| Requests     | Expiry rate                                               |
| Capacity     | Mentor utilisation against declared capacity              |
| Sessions     | Sessions per active mentorship                            |
| Sessions     | Session completion rate                                   |
| Goals        | Goal completion rate                                      |
| Engagement   | At-risk mentorship recovery rate                          |
| Satisfaction | Student satisfaction                                      |
| Satisfaction | Mentor satisfaction                                       |
| Outcomes     | Mentoring participation in relation to placement outcomes |

The supplied P11 specification does not define numerical business targets for these metrics. Those targets should therefore be agreed during discovery rather than invented in this document.

## 18. Open Product Decisions

The source specification establishes the product direction but does not provide values for the following. These must be decided during discovery:

1. What institutional record is authoritative for verification?
2. What exactly constitutes successful alumni verification?
3. What mentor profile information should students see?
4. What default mentor capacity should be used?
5. What availability information should students see?
6. What is the maximum number of active requests per student?
7. How long should an unanswered request remain active?
8. What exactly constitutes declining engagement?
9. When should an engagement nudge occur?
10. Which factors should determine mentor relevance?
11. Which calendar providers are enabled for the initial release?
12. Which video-conferencing provider is used?
13. Which notification channels are enabled?
14. Which placement outcomes can be used for programme analysis?
15. What reporting views are required by each institutional role?
16. What is the initial pilot population?

---

## 20. Source Basis

This PRD is based on the **EduRev Project List — P11: Alumni Mentorship and Career Network** and the applicable **Common Engineering Standard (CES)**.

P11-specific requirements have been preserved as product requirements, while values not defined by the source are recorded as open product decisions rather than assumed.
